# Dark Slack - Windows
A dark Slack theme script (Slack versions up to 3.4.3 or 4.0.0 and above) for Windows clients. The theme is provided by laCour (https://github.com/laCour/slack-night-mode). One may not edit/redistibute unmodified or modified versions of this project's files by any means. Only private usage allowed. In order to apply theme:

# V 1.0.0 - 3.4.3
Download *DarkSlack_3.4.3.cmd* file and run it as admin. Wait till console window closes.

# V 4.0.0 and above
Download both *DarkSlack_4.cmd* and *DarkSlack_4.ps1* files. Run *DarkSlack_4.cmd* and wait till process finishes. If you don't have 7-Zip installed, the script will download and install a temporary instance including an asar plugin required to unwrap Slack archieve. After its completion, 7-Zip will be uninstalled and all leftovers deleted. In case you have 7-Zip already installed, the script will only check for asar plugin and download it if it's missing. It'll apply theme then.
